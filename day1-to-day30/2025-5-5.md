# LeetCode 11 Container With Most Water (盛最多水的容器)

## Question

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).  
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.  
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

## Thought

- Maintain two pointers: one to the left, the other to the right.
- While left pointer is still smaller than the right pointer:
  - Compute current area of the container
  - Record the largest area.
  - Shorten the width (move shorter one to the middle)

## Code

<pre>```Java
class Solution {
    public int moveZeroes(int[] nums) {
       int left = 0, right = height.length - 1;
        int maxArea = 0;

        while (left < right) {
            int minHeight = Math.min(height[left], height[right]);
            int width = right - left;
            int area = minHeight * width;
            maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, area);

            // Move shorter pointer to the middle.
            if (height[left] < height[right]) {
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }

        return maxArea;
    }
}
```</pre>
